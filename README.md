# Text-Filter
This project is one that I worked on for my Object-Oriented Programming class (CS 180 - Purdue University). This project is a basic text filter built in Java. The client is greeted with three options when the program is running, Filter Word, Find-and-Replace, and Censor Information. Filter word allows the client to enter a word that they want to censor from a passage that the client also inputs. Find-and-Replace replaces a word in the given passage with the desired replacement instead of just filtering it. Censor Information finds desired info in a given passage and censors everything that is desired instead of just one word.
